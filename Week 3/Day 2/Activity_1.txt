Advantages:
    It eases the development processes
    Makes it ease to find and track errors
    V model is straightforward to use and the architecture is cadid which is a plus point in its design

Disadvantages:
    Its a hard model to execute compared to other software
    It has a regid structure making flexibility limited and making it overall not suitable for object oriented software
    Management of the V model is pretty risky and unstable

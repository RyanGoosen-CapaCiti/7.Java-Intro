Explain the difference between Access Modifiers and Non Access Modifiers
    Access Modifiers: Access modifiers in Java determine the accessibility or visibility of classes, methods, attributes, and other members within a program
    Non Access Modifiers: Non-access modifiers in Java provide additional information or functionality to classes, methods, attributes, and other members

What the access modifiers available in java and describe their access levels
    public: This access modifier allows unrestricted access to the class, method, or attribute from any other part of the program, including other packages
    protected: Members with the protected access modifier are accessible within the same package as well as in subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
    private: The private access modifier restricts the accessibility of a member to within the same class
    Default (no explicit modifier): If no access modifier is specified, the member is considered to have default access

What the Non Access Modifiers for classes in java
    Indicates that the class cannot be inherited or extended by any other class.
    Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly and are typically used as base classes for other classes

What the Non Access Modifiers for attributes and method in java
    Static
    Final
    Synchronized
    Transient

Modularity and Reusability: Code can be reused without having to retype it
Code Organization: Code that work together can br grouped in a class with similar code
Inheritance: Falls under reuseability as you can just call a class that has all the same things you want to use into a different class
Maintainability and Scalability: As the code is grouped it can easily be changed
